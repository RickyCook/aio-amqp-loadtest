    $ docker run -it --rm thatpanda/aioamqp-loadtest:latest

*Optionally*, you can also build the Docker image locally. If you don't do this,
the auto-built image from Docker Hub will be pulled and should be exactly the
same.

    $ docker build -t thatpanda/aioamqp-loadtest:latest .
    ...

## Stopping

Ctrl+C or any kind of kill signal will cleanly stop all services in Docker, and
both clients.
